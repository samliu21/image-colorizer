## Model
The first part of the neural network uses the pretrained VGG16 network. The second part of the network is a series of 2D convolution, dropout, upsampling, and 2D convolution transpose layers. The model uses the Adam optimizer and the mean squared error loss function.

A summary of the neural network can be found below:

```
Receives grayscale input images of size (224, 224, 3), where the R, G, and B values are the same.
